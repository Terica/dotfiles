These are config files from a trusted vim evangelist.

Vim-users will likely find useful stuff in the [vimrc](vimrc), and also the [Ruby snippets](vim/snippets/ruby.snippets). This is an understatement.

If you use aliases, then you might find a few you like in [zsh/aliases](zsh/aliases).

## Installation - go get the real thing!

  `git clone git://github.com/r00k/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles`  
  `cd ~/.dotfiles`  
  `rake install`

  Vim plugins are managed through vundle. You'll need to install vundle to get them.

  `git clone https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim`  
  
  Run `:BundleInstall` in vim.
